# How to manage a Project with Issues, etc
When you're developing a project in a team, and even on your own, you should keep track of the `tasks` you are currently developing, those you're going to work on in the next week and always have in mind which or the phases of development of your part of the project

## Issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your project. 

They can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 

Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHubâ€™s tracker is called `Issues`, and has its own section in every repository.

### Elements of an Issue:

* A **title and descriptio**n describe what the issue is about.
* Coloured **labels** help you categorize and filter your issues
* A **milestone** is a way to associate issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16 or Shipping 1.0).
* One **assignee** is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
* **Comments** allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback
