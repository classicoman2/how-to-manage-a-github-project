# How to manage a Project with Issues, etc
When you're developing a project in a team, and even on your own, you should keep track of the `tasks`. 

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your project. 

They can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 

Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHubâ€™s tracker is called `Issues`, and has its own section in every repository.
