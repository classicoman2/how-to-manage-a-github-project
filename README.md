# How to manage a Project with Issues, etc
When you're developing a project in a team, and even on your own, you should keep track of the `tasks` you are currently developing, those you're going to work on in the next week and always have in mind which or the phases of development of your part of the project

## (1) Working with Issues, Milestones, Labels, Notifications, etc.

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your project. 

They can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 

Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called `Issues`, and has its own section in every repository.

### Elements of an Issue:

* A **title and descriptio**n describe what the issue is about.
* Coloured **labels** help you categorize and filter your issues
* A **milestone** is a way to associate issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16 or Shipping 1.0).
* One **assignee** is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
* **Comments** allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback

### Milestones

Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. 

* Sprint — File issues that you’d like to work until an specific deadline --> so you can focus on what's important now
* etc.
* Beta Launch — File bugs that you need to fix before you can launch the beta of your project --> so you don't forget anything

### Notifications, @mentions, and References
By using @mentions and references inside of Issues, you can notify other GitHub users & teams and cross-connect issues.

They provide a flexible way to get people involved to resolve issues effectively. They are part of the text formatting syntax called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github#name-and-team-mentions-autocomplete).

## (2) Projects

You can create a Project to manage the Issues and Tasks, create Notes and follow the completion of the tasks and the whole project in a progress bar.

When you create a project, you can choose between these setups:

* **Basic kanban**: Track your tasks with To do, In progress, and Done columns
* **Automated kanban**:	Cards automatically move between To do, In progress, and Done columns
* **Automated kanban with review**:	Cards automatically move between To do, In progress, and Done columns, with additional triggers for pull request review status
* **Bug triage**:	Triage and prioritize bugs with To do, High priority, Low priority, and Closed columns
People use them in software development to:
